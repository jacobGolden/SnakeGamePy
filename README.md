The intention of this repository is to familiarize myself with python by building a program using a tutorial, and then
improving the build over time until it is unique to myself.

improvement planned:
- add main menu
- make sure food/mushroom can't spawn on snake

- give snake a face that turns with its direction
- add loss screen
    - add high score to loss screen
- add win screen
    - add high score to win screen
- add "mushroom" that causes player to lose points but stay the same length if eaten ----->DONE
