# SnakeGamePy

_Further development on this project is unlikely as other responsibilites have kept me from fulfilling the other optional improvements._

Snake game in python with GUI.

Built with guidance from the Kite YouTube channel.
    Link to his source code here: https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/blob/master/snake/snake.py
    
How to Play:
- Use arrow keys to guide the snake
- the yellow square is the bird +1 point for each one you eat
- the other colored squares are toxic mushrooms, -1/-3/-5 penalty for each one you eat (based on their color)
- the white chain is your snake. It will grow with each bird, but will stay the same size when you eat a mushroom
- How big can you get the snake before it eats itself?

includes:
- GUI implementation
- 2d graphical output
- active score tracking
- randomization
- keyboard input
- original theme music!

- sound effects

The intention of this repository is to familiarize myself with python by building a program using a tutorial, and then
improving the build over time until it is unique to myself.

improvement planned:
- add main menu
- make sure food/mushroom can't spawn on snake
- make sure food/mushroom can't spawn on eachother
- make walls solid (ie snake can't pass through them to cross the grid)
- give snake a face that turns with its direction
- add loss screen
    - add high score to loss screen
- add win screen
    - add high score to win screen
