# SnakeGamePy
Snake game in python with GUI.

Built with guidance from the Kite YouTube channel.
    Link to his source code here: https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/blob/master/snake/snake.py

- includes:
    - GUI implementation
    - 2d graphical output
    - score tracking
    - randomization
    - keyboard input

The intention of this repository is to familiarize myself with python by building a program using a tutorial, and then
improving the build over time until it is unique to myself.
