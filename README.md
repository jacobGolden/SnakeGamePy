# SnakeGamePy
Snake game in python with GUI.

Built with guidance from the Kite YouTube channel.
    Link to his source code here: https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/blob/master/snake/snake.py

includes:
- GUI implementation
- 2d graphical output
- score tracking
- randomization
- keyboard input

The intention of this repository is to familiarize myself with python by building a program using a tutorial, and then
improving the build over time until it is unique to myself.

improvement planned:
- make sure food can't spawn on snake
- make walls solid (ie snake can't pass through them to cross the grid
- change color scheme
- give snake a face that turns with its direction
- add loss screen
- add win screen
